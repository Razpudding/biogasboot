# Biogasboot data visualization
Through sensors that themselves report their data, data is generated about the fermentation process. This data is received by us and translated to a (data) visualisation for both operators and visitors that visit the cafe "De Ceuvel".

Biogasboot data visualization: [Live demo not available yet](#)

## Concept
We have 2 specific target audiences that both needed their own approach.
- **The operators** of the Biogasboot, they have to see all the data that is coming from the sensors of the Biogasboot.
- **The customers** of café De Ceuvel, they don't need all the data but only a fraction of it so realize what the Biogasboot does.

### Operators
The operator is the person who takes control of the food waste digester. He or she wants to know the current state of the digester with the current values of the process parameters. Historical data should be accessible to the operator to determine if a new adjustment had a good effect on the process compared to a previous run. Remarkable trends in the data should also be notified which the operator gets the response of.

### Customers
When a customer is at the bar he or she sees the large TV screen with the Biogasboot it's data. We know that all customers have to order add the bar so they have to see it. It's important that the customer almost instantly knows what the data on the screen means, this can be done for example with illustrations and leading titles. Also the customers have to know from what date the data is measured until the current date. They have to realize how "bio clean" café De Ceuvel's kitchen is.

## Usage
For now operators can see live visualizations of the data generated on the Biogasboot. The visualization shows all the values that are available. It is also possible to look at the historical data. The filter funcionality isn't finished yet though. There are multiple API endpoints that can be used to filter and format the data from the FTP server.

Administrators can register new accounts for other admins and operators. Soon a dashboard for Café de Ceuvel will follow, as well as a interactive website where users can learn more about the Biogasboot. See the ToDo list below for more functions to come!

## Stakeholders
- Operators of the Biogasboot.
- Customers of café "De Ceuvel".
- Employees of café "De Ceuvel".
- The planet :earth_africa:.

## Features
- User system with roles (register and login)
- User management panel for administrators
- Dashboard for the operators with live visualized data from the Biogasboot
- Dashboard for searching and comparing Historical data, visualized in D3
- Dashboard with live visualizations for in Café de Ceuvel


### Single features

***Data Flow: From Boat to Mongo***

The flow has been simulated with test data. The Bio-gas boat is not capable yet to send data in real-time.

![Data flow](md-media/flow-chart-data.png)

***API: Filter data from the API***
This function gets all the data from the API and filters and formats it according to the date and format parameters. For example: Get the average per day in a specific range.
```javascript
function filterData(format, date, data) {
  const returnData = [];
  // Create a new dataObject
  const dataObject = {
    Date: new Date(Number(date) * 1000),
    'Temp_PT100_1': 0,
    'Temp_PT100_2': 0,
    pH_Value: 0,
    Bag_Height: 0,
    count: 0
  };
  const parsedDate = parseDate(new Date(Number(date) * 1000));
  // Fill the dataObject with the data of that day
  data.forEach(function(point) {
    let thisDate = parseDate(point.Date);
    if (thisDate == parsedDate) {
      dataObject['Temp_PT100_1'] = dataObject['Temp_PT100_1'] + Number(point['Temp_PT100_1']);
      dataObject['Temp_PT100_2'] = dataObject['Temp_PT100_2'] + Number(point['Temp_PT100_2']);
      dataObject['pH_Value'] = dataObject['pH_Value'] + Number(point['pH_Value']);
      dataObject['Bag_Height'] = dataObject['Bag_Height'] + Number(point['Bag_Height']);
      dataObject['count'] = dataObject['count'] + 1;
    }
  });
  returnData.push(dataObject);
  return returnData;
}
```

## API Endpoints
The application has multiple API endpoints. This is an overview of all the possibilities.

**All data**
`/api/all`
This call returns an object with all the data that is available.

**Date Range data**
`/api/all?dateStart=1489720679&dateEnd=1490268059`
This call returns an object with all the data within the specified date-range The date has to be a UNIX timestamp. You declare the start- and end datel

**Data for a specific day**
`/api/all?format=d&date=1490400000`
This call returns the data of a specific day. All values are added up and the 'count' value can be used to divide the values to get the average of that day. This call needs an UNIX timestamp as date.

**Average per day in a specific range**
`/api/all?dateStart=1489720679&dateEnd=1490268059&format=d`
Get the average per day in a specific range. Use a UNIX timestamp as date, followed by `&format=d`

## Notifications with ServiceWorker
As addition on the websockets we made a ServiceWorker that can send notifications to devices that are subscribed. This is very usefull when a warning state is triggered but the operator isn't watching is phone dashboard. The subscriptions are saved in the MongoDB database so when the server restarts the subscriptions aren't gone To send notifications we needed a GCM_API_KEY (Google Cloud Messaging).

The notifications are used for the real-time dashboard so the operator doesn't have to watch his phone all the time.

## Calculation with the data
The Biogasboot stores the data in a CSV file but this RAW data and we can't do everything with this that. Some stakeholder want a bundle of multiple values but those bundles aren't found in the CSV files.

### Usage calculations
The calculations we did are mostly found in modules/usage-calculation.js here is calculated how long a device is ON in 1 month. When we know how long it's ON we can calculate the energy usage in Wh and kWh. Those calculations are stored in an object and then pushed to the front-end. For every calculation there is a comment how the calculation is working.

## Config variables
The application makes use variables that aren't clear yet so we made a config file where all the different variables are stored.

The config can be founded in the folder "modules/config.js". Here you can define the following things:
 * The min, max, low, high values of a parameter like PH value or gasbag.
 * The above has impact on the tileStatus function that will define the state of a value.
 * Every device has it's own usage per hour this can also changed here.
 * When the control panel of the Biogasboot is connected to a FTP server you can also modify the FTP settings.

```javascript

// It can be included in front-end and backend files you only need to call the right function that you needed

// For backend modules
const config = require('./config');

// For front-end modules
const config = require('../../../modules/config');
```
