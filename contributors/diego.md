# Contribution of Diego Staphorst
## Introduction
This project has been carried out together with [Sjoerd](https://github.com/sjoerdbeentjes) & [Timo](https://github.com/TimoVerkroost), two classmates from the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. We executed our last project of the semester with a commissioner of [The Biogas Boat](http://www.biogasboot.nl/). This boat can convert organic waste into biogas which can be cooked with in [de Ceuvel](http://deceuvel.nl/). This has to be done to close loops, which helps by creating a sustainable environment.

In order to monitor the entire digestion process of organic waste into biogas, several sensors have been placed on the boat. These sensors are located in the digester, at the gas bag, on the boat to keep track of the gas supply to the Ceuvel and one for the temperature outside the boat.

### Web of Things
The BioGas boat has alot of sensorts on board. The operators and control panel need this to have an overlook about what is going on during the digestion process. On board are also different devices to help controlling the process, like heaters, mixers, feed pumps and blowers. To determine the efficiency in the boat, these are also included in the calculations. Below is a table of the various devices.
